# Development notes

We make some of the development files available in case they are of interest to you. MISP Cloud is heavily based on [misp-packer](https://github.com/MISP/misp-packer) for the bootstrap portion of the project. Other files include the configuration files for [Packer](https://packer.io), the tool we utilize to create and manage the images. 

Check Packer [Starter Guide](https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html) if you would like to learn more.
